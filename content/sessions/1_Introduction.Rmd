## About This Course

<br>
<br>
This (short) course will teach you how to exploit `R` and apply some of its geospatial techniques.*

By the end of this course, you should...

- be less frightened with using geospatial data in `R`
  - including importing, wrangling, and exploring geospatial data
- be able to create (simple) maps based on your very own processed geospatial data in `R`

.footnote[*Some materials are part of a previous workshop, for which I'd like to thank [Anne-Kathrin Stroppe](https://twitter.com/AStroppe).]

## What Are Geospatial Data?

.pull-left[
Data with a direct spatial reference $\rightarrow$ **geo-coordinates**
- Information about geometries
- Optional: Content in relation to the geometries

Can be projected jointly in one single space
- Allows data linking and extraction of substantial information

## Geospatial Data in This Course 

In the folder called `./data` in the same folder as the other materials for this workshop, you can find the data files prepped for all the exercises and slides.

- Covid-19 cases for Cologne across the city's districts available at the [Open Data Portal of Cologne](https://www.offenedaten-koeln.de/dataset/corona-fallzahlen-koeln)
- Hospital locations in Cologne are also distributed via the [Open Data Portal of Cologne](https://www.offenedaten-koeln.de/dataset/krankenh%C3%A4user-k%C3%B6ln)
- Cologne's road network; [guess from where](https://www.offenedaten-koeln.de/dataset/strasse)
- Number of immigrants and inhabitants from German Census 2011 data are provided by the [Federal Statistical Office Germany, Wiesbaden 2020](https://www.zensus2011.de/EN/Home/home_node.html)

**Please make sure that if you reuse any of the provided data to cite the original data sources.**

## What Is GIS?

Most common understanding: Geographic Information Systems (GIS) as specific software to process geospatial data for 
- Visualization
- Analysis

```{r pic-gis, echo = FALSE, out.width = "70%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath("./content/img/gis.png"))
```

```

]

.pull-right[
Formats
- Vector data (points, lines, polygons)
- Raster data (grids)

Coordinate reference systems (CRS)
- Allow the projection on earth's surface
- Differ in precision for specific purposes
]

## Layers Must Match!

## Types of CRS

<br>
.pull-left[
**Projected CRS**
- projection of geometries on a flat surface (planar)
- distance between two points is a straight line
]

.pull-right[
**Geographic CRS**
- (unprojected) description of specific points on a sphere
- distance between two points is a bent line
]

<br>
(There are also geocentric CRS requiring a z-coordinate...)

```

## EPSG Codes

.pull-left[
Eventually, it's not as challenging to work with CRS in `R` as it may seem
- we don't have to use PROJ.4 or WKT strings directly.

Most of the times it's enough to use so-called EPSG Codes ("European Petroleum Survey Group Geodesy")
- Small digit sequence

## More Details on Geospatial Data

Let's learn about geospatial data as we learn about specific formats:
- vector data 
- raster data

.pull-left[
```{r geo-real-worls, echo = FALSE, out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath("./content/img/Raster-and-Vector-data-types-as-representative-of-real-world-geographic-space_W640.jpg"))
```

.tinyisher[.center[[Source](https://dx.doi.org/10.13140/2.1.3030.1767)]]
]

.pull-right[
Be assured: `R` can serve as a full-blown Geographic Information System (GIS) for all these different data types.

## `R` Packages for Geospatial Data

There have been packages for geospatial data in `R` already for a long time.

.pull-left[
- [`sp`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sp/index.html) for vector data
- [`raster`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/raster/index.html) for raster data
  - the successor: [`terra`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/terra/index.html)


Cutting-edge for vector data and raster data (cubes)
- [`sf`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/index.html)
- [`stars`](https://r-spatial.github.io/stars/)
]

.pull-right[
<br>
```{r pic-sf, echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath("./content/img/sf.jpg"))
```

## Packages in This Course

We will use plenty of different packages during the course, but only a few are our main drivers (e.g., the `sf` package). Here's the list of packages


- [`dplyr`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/index.html)
- [`mapview`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mapview/index.html)
- [`sf`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/index.html)
- [`stars`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stars/index.html)
- [`tmap`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmap/index.html)
- [`tmaptools`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmaptools/index.html)

*Note*: Some additional packages will be installed as dependencies.

## What You'll See During the Course: Piping In `R`

Usually, in `R` we apply functions as follows:

```{r function-r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
f(x)
```

In the logic of pipes this function is written as:

```{r function-pipe, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
x %>% f(.)
```

--

We can use pipes on more than one function:

```{r function-pipe-2, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
x %>% 
  f_1() %>% 
  f_2() %>% 
  f_3()
```
